# Shop
Shop, ... is not a shop for true :grimacing:. I simply didn't know how to claim a repository that I wanted to use to play with Golang, Go-Kit and Microservices. And of course, Openshift as usual.

[**Inventory**](inventory/Readme.md) is a very simple REST service written in **Golang** with **GO-Kit**. It is actually a No-Op, but it is very valuable because it is structured taking in account of **clean architecture** and it implements both **logging** and **instrumentation** (with **Prometheus**).
So it is definetely a very clean and simple example to learn how to code with GO-Kit.
