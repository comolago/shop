# Shop Project
You should create a dedicated project:
```
oc new-project shop --description "A fake shop project to be used only to learn GO-Kit on Openshift" --display-name="Shop"
```

* [Inventory](/inventory/README.md) is our fake inventory microservice ([**Build it**](inventory/build/README.md); [**Deploy it**](inventory/deploy/README.md))
